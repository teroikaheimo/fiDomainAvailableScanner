# fiDomainAvailableScanner
I needed a way to check multiple .FI domain names availability fast so this program was the answer to that.

## Needed to run:
- Node(tested on v10.15.3)

## Installation
In the terminal of your choosing
1. Run 'git clone repoURL'
2. Run in the root folder of the project 'npm install'

## Usage
1. Run in the project root folder 'npm start'
2. Add domains you want to search to the generated text file(follow the prompt)
3. Run 'npm start' to search those names;

### NOTE! 
The application will APPEND the results to the results file after every search. 
So remove the old file if earlier results are not needed.
